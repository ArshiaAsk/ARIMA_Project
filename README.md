# 🛢️ Oil Price Forecasting using ARIMA

This project aims to forecast global oil prices using historical time series data and the ARIMA model. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model selection, and forecasting.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To apply time series analysis with ARIMA on real oil price data to:

- Explore and visualize oil price trends
- Fit multiple ARIMA models
- Evaluate performance (AIC, RMSE, etc.)
- Generate short-term forecasts
